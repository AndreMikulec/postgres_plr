### What is This?

The Appveyor YAML markup of this respository, is composed of instructions needed to build, on Windows, using MSYS2 (instead of Microsoft Visual Studio), the PostgreSQL contributed extension "plr" (PL/R - PostgreSQL support for R as a procedural language (PL)).

This extension allows a PostgreSQL SQL developer to write code using the "R" programming language inside the "PostgreSQL database on Windows."
